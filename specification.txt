different pages based on the input.

Bootstrap Implementation: Bootstrap is integrated into all HTML files by linking the Bootstrap CSS file in the `<head>` section. This allows the use of
Bootstrap's predefined CSS classes to style elements and create responsive layouts throughout the website. Bootstrap classes like container, row, col, btn,
etc., are used throughout the HTML files to create responsive layouts and style elements such as buttons, navigation bars, and containers.
